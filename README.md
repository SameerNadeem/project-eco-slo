# project-eco-slo

I have written TypeScript code to transform the data into suitable formats for our charts and create the visualizations using HTML, CSS, and Vega-Lite are used to create a website that displays visualizations based on data from a JSON fileI have incorporated three Vega-lite figures into our report. The project aims to analyze and visualize data related to beach cleanup events. It includes three main visualizations:
The Amount of Events Over Time: This chart shows the number of events held each year from 2014 to 2022. It uses an area chart to display the data. The Weight of Trash and Recycling Over the Years: This chart illustrates how the amount of trash and recycling collected during cleanup events has changed over time. It uses a bar chart to show the weight of trash and recycling for each year from 2014 to 2022. The Number of Volunteers Over Time: This chart displays the number of adult and child volunteers participating in cleanup events over the years. It uses a line chart to represent the data. These visualizations provide insights into the trends and patterns related to beach cleanup events, including the number of events held, the amount of trash and recycling collected, and the participation of volunteers.
My data-driven web-based report presents interesting findings from the Eco SLO dataset and contributes to understanding the impact of beach cleanups and community engagement in preserving the environment
P.S. there are a lot of hidden files your not going to need to understand the code base
